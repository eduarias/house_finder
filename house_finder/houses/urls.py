"""
To design URLs for an app, you create a Python module informally called a URLconf (URL configuration).
This module is pure Python code and is a mapping between URL path expressions to Python functions
(your views).

This mapping can be as short or as long as needed. It can reference other mappings. And, because
itâ€™s pure Python code, it can be constructed dynamically.
